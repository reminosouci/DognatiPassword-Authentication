# Dognation: Password Authentication

# Welcome to Dognation!

In this project, we will implement user authentication features using express-sessions, Passport's passport-local strategy, and bcrypt.js. This will allow users to register, log in, stay authenticated, and log out of the app securely.

# Authentication Flow

Register a new user.
Log in with the registered user.
Log out to end the session.
Feel free to explore other features of Dognation!
